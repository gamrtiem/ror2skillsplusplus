## Project goals

I often found some character abilities to be underwhelming as runs progressed and that one ability would become more powerful that others.
This mod hopes to provide an additional sense of progression and giving your character a feeling of power throughout a run.

## Usage

While ingame your will earn points every third level gained (4, 7, 10,...) that can be used to purches upgrades to your characters skills.
To redeem points open the info screen (hold TAB by default) and click the skill you would like to buy.

> ***NOTE:*** This mod is still a work in progress. There is no guarantee that SkillsPlusPlus is going to work with other mods thats alter character abilities. If you have found a bug refer to [Report a bug](#report-a-bug)
